In addition to the Graduate Student Research Support Award, I had also submitted an application package to the Texas Tech University Doctoral Dissertation Completion Fellowship. This fellowship allows recipients to focus an academic year on finishing their dissertation, and promotes dissertation completion in a timely manny.

Today, my advisor told me that I had been awarded this fellowship! This will allow me to not teach in the Fall and Spring semesters of next year, and focus on finishing my dissertation and publishing a few more of my chapters prior to my defense. It'll also allow me to free up some time to start focusing on submitting a few postdoctoral fellowships and start hunting for already funded postdocs. 2022 is certainly off to a great start!

In January, I submitted an application package to the Texas Tech University Graduate Student Research Support Award. This small grant awards research funds up to $1,000 to fund any graduate student research needs, particularly those that contribute to the completion of thesis projects.

I submitted an application to fund a few remaining leaf δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses from my third dissertation chapter. My third dissertation chapter investigates primary drivers of leaf nitrogen allocation and water-use efficiency across a broad precipitation gradient in Texas. As leaf δ<sup>13</sup>C is a reliable proxy for water-use efficiency, these analyses are critical to the completion of this chapter.

Today, I received word that I was awarded the funds I had requested to complete these analyses! This is exciting, as it is the last remaining piece of data I need to finish this chapter. The next few months will be spent rolling tin capsules for these samples and shipping them out to the University of California-Davis Stable Isotope Facility, and I'll hopefully have these data by the end of the summer.

2021 was a very busy year, and unfortunately this website was not regularly updated to reflect that. Some notable accomplishments in 2021 include passing my qualifying exams and becoming a Ph.D. candidate, publishing my first, first-authored paper, and completing my third and final field season. What some might consider a new year's resolution, I will try to provide at least monthly updates this year as I navigate the final year of this doctorate degree. Here's to a productive and healthy new year.
