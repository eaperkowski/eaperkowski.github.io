Hello! My name is Evan Perkowski and I am a current second-year PhD student at Texas Tech University in Dr. Nick Smith's [lab](http://www.smithecophyslab.com/). I am originally from Pennsylvania, where I completed my undergraduate degree in biology at Widener University just outside of Philadelphia.
