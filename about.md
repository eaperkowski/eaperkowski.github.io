Hello! My name is Evan Perkowski. I am a current fifth-year PhD candidate at Texas Tech University working in Dr. Nick Smith's [lab](http://www.smithecophyslab.com/). 

My research broadly focuses on aboveground-belowground interactions, plant ecophysiology, and ecosystem ecology. Specifically, my research focuses on eliciting mechanisms that allow us to better understand how plant nutrient acquisition and allocation strategies shift under different environmental conditions through a combination of greenhouse, growth chamber, and field experiments. 

To find out more about my current research interests, please feel free to navigate to the [Research]("/Research.md") tab on this website.
