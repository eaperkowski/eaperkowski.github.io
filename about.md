Hello, I'm Evan! I am a current third-year PhD student at Texas Tech University working in Dr. Nick Smith's [lab](http://www.smithecophyslab.com/) studying the influence of environmental conditions and soil characteristics on photosynthetic traits. I am also interested in soil microbe-plant-herbivore tritrophic interactions, fungal endophytes, mycorrhizal fungi, and general plant responses to global change.

I aspire to earn a tenure-track position at a predominately undergraduate or R02 institution that has a strong emphasis on undergraduate mentorship, particularly students who come from traditionally underrepresented minority groups. I am also a member of the LGBTQ+ community, and hope to use my visibility as a catalyst for improving the representation and inclusivity of the LGBTQ+ community in the field of ecology.
