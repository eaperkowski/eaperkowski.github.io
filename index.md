Thank you for navigating to my personal website! My name is Evan Perkowski and I am a current PhD student at Texas Tech University in Dr. Nick Smith's [lab](http://www.smithecophyslab.com/). I am a plant ecophysiologist and microbial ecologist broadly interested in understanding how coupled carbon-nitrogen dynamics differ in plant communities with different nutrient acquisition strategies, and how these differences may shift under different climates or soil resource thresholds. If you'd like to know more about the type of research I'm currently up to, feel free to navigate to the [Current Research](/research/) tab.

I am also using this website to provide folks with my [Contact Information](/about/), maintain an updated online [Curriculum Vitae](/cv/), and post relevant [News](/blog/) as they occur. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or if you have any questions/would like to start up a conversation about anything related to my work.

Note: this website is currently under construction and not fully functional yet!
