Thank you for navigating to my personal website! My name is Evan Perkowski and I am a current PhD student at Texas Tech University in Dr. Nick Smith's [lab](http://www.smithecophyslab.com/). I am a plant ecophysiologist and microbial ecologist broadly broadly interested in plant nitrogen acquisition and allocation responses to global change. I am particularly interested in understanding effects of climate and soil controls on leaf and whole plant photosynthesis. If you'd like to know more about the type of research I'm either currently conducting or interested in, feel free to navigate to the [Current Research](/research/) tab. I am always seeking collaborations with others, particularly those from traditionally under-represented minority groups, so shoot me a line if one of our interests align.

I am also using this website to provide folks with my [Contact Information](/about/), maintain an updated online [Curriculum Vitae](/cv/), and post relevant [News](/blog/) as they occur.

Note: this website is currently under construction and not fully functional yet!
