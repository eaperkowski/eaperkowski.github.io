Thank you for navigating to my personal website! My name is Evan Perkowski and I am a current PhD student at Texas Tech University in Dr. Nick Smith's [lab](http://www.smithecophyslab.com/). I am a plant ecophysiologist and microbial ecologist interested in understanding how coupled carbon-nitrogen dynamics differ in plant communities with different nutrient acquisition strategies, and how these differences may shift in a changing climate. I am also interested in understanding how nutrient acquisition strategies impact carbon-nitrogen dynamics in plant communities and how this may scale to ecosystem biogeochemical processes. If you'd like to know more about the type of research I'm currently up to, feel free to navigate to the [Research](/research/) tab.
