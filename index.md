Thank you for navigating to my personal website! My name is Evan Perkowski and I am a current PhD student at Texas Tech University in Dr. Nick Smith's [lab](http://www.smithecophyslab.com/). I am a plant ecophysiologist and microbial ecologist interested in aboveground-belowground interactions, plant responses to global change, and large scale ecological modeling. If you'd like to know more about the type of research I'm up to, feel free to navigate to the [Research](/research/) tab.
