<p>I am a post-doc in the Smith Plant Ecophysiology Lab at Texas Tech University who is interested in photosynthetic acclimation and nutrient allocation responses to global change, mainly from optimality perspectives. I received my Ph.D. from Texas Tech University in May 2023 after successful defense of my dissertation, which was titled "Drivers of plant nutrient acquisition and allocation strategies and their influence on plant responses to environmental change".</p>

<p>Much of my work strives to provide empirical data needed to test underlying assumptions made by terrestrial biosphere and land surface models about drivers of photosynthetic processes. I am particularly interested in understanding how symbioses between plants and soil microbial communities scale to modify leaf and whole plant physiological processes under environmental scenarios which manipulate plant nutrient demand (e.g., light availability, CO<sub>2</sub>, etc.) and/or plant nutrient supply (e.g., soil nitrogen availability, soil texture, etc.). I am currently involved in several projects striving to better understand these patterns, and look forward to sharing them both here on this website and more broadly in the plant ecophysiological and modeling communities</p>

<p>Finally, I am always interested in collaborating and chatting about plant ecology or plant ecophysiology.
