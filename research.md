I am a plant ecophysiologist who is interested in understanding plant nutrient acquisition and allocation responses to global change. My doctoral research specifically focuses on eliciting mechanisms that drive plant nutrient acquisition and allocation responses to different environmental conditions. I use a combination of greenhouse and growth chamber experiments to deduce mecahnisms that drive these responses, and field experiments to determine whether these patterns are realistic and occur in nature.

The following is a test from the Smith Ecophys Lab code to figure out if HTML cod styles can be applied to markdown files, and take a look at how these code look on a jekyll style webpage

      <br>
      
      <p>Nick joined others from the
      <a href = "https://research.reading.ac.uk/lemontree/">LEMONTREE</a> group
      for their first in-person meeting of the project in Reading, UK.
      The project meeting brought together individuals from the various groups
      working on the project. We hashed out ideas and plans for the second year of the 5-year project.
      Look out for more from us soon!

Experiment #1: How does nutrient availability affect leaf and whole plant processes?

Experiment #2: How does nutrient availability and aboveground climate affect tradeoffs between foliar nitrogen and water use efficiency?

Experiment #3: How does plant nitrogen demand and availability influence carbon costs to acquire nitrogen across different acquisition strategies?

Experiment #4: How do microbial symbioses affect leaf and whole plant acclimation to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>?
