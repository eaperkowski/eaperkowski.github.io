I am a plant ecophysiologist with broad interests in plant acclimation responses to environmental change. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how nutrient availability influences leaf and whole plant acclimation responses to aboveground climate (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>, light availability), and how these responses might be further modified by different dominant modes of nutrient acquisition (e.g., direct uptake, microbial symbioses, etc.).

During my doctoral research, I have used a combination of greenhouse, growth chamber, and field experiments to resolve mechanisms that drive leaf nitrogen allocation and photosynthetic responses to shifts in soil nitrogen availability. Below, I provide a brief synopsis of the major experimental chapters of my dissertation, including links to papers where relevant.
