I am a plant ecophysiologist who is interested in understanding plant nutrient acquisition and allocation responses to global change. My doctoral research specifically focuses on eliciting mechanisms that drive plant nutrient acquisition and allocation responses to different environmental conditions. I use a combination of greenhouse and growth chamber experiments to deduce mecahnisms that drive these responses, and field experiments to determine whether these patterns are realistic and occur in nature. My doctoral research can be boiled down to four primary experiments:

Experiment #1: How does nutrient availability affect leaf and whole plant processes?

Experiment #2: How does nutrient availability and aboveground climate affect tradeoffs between foliar nitrogen and water use efficiency?

Experiment #3: How does plant nitrogen demand and availability influence carbon costs to acquire nitrogen across different acquisition strategies?

Experiment #4: How do microbial symbioses affect leaf and whole plant acclimation to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>?
