Evan, Nick (Smith Lab PI), Kelly (Smith Lab manager), and Snehanjana (Smith Lab PhD student) went out to Trillium Trail last week in Fox Chapel, PA to measure CO<sub>2</sub> response curves and collect chlorophyll fluorescence data in <i>Trillium grandiflorum</i>, <i>Maianthemum racemosum</i>, and <i>Arisaema triphyllum</i> growing in a long-term garlic mustard removal experiment.

The three species are native to western Pennsylvania and are actively being invaded by garlic mustard (<i>Alliaria petiolata</i>) populations. Garlic mustard is an invasive biennial species that releases glucosinolates belowground, a secondary metabolite that can modify belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal communities. Changes in belowground fungal communities may increase the cost of acquiring nutrients in native species, which should reduce native species photosynthetic capacity and productivity throughout the growing season.

The response curves measured this past week, in addition to a previous campaign in late April, will provide key insights into understanding the influence of garlic mustard invasion on native species physiology and seasonal carbon budgets.
