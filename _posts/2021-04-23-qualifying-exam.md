This is going to be a quick degree progress update and my first official installment in this news page. This past month I partook in my qualifying exams to reach candidacy. These exams included a week-long written exam and an oral exam. My committee was satisfied with my responses for both the written and oral portion of this qualifying exam and recommended my advancement to candidacy!

This was a great learning opportunity and I am excited to fill in the gaps of knowledge that were exposed during this exam process. I am also very thankful to have such a helpful and positive group of committee members.
